Supplementary analyses:

1 - S.1-S.5 performs analyses to evaluate coverage statistics and on-target read statistics for the HS targeted capture.
    Summaries of these analyses are then assessed and figures are produced using the capture_coverage_analysis.Rmd
	markdown in the 'markdowns' directory.
	
2 - S.6_singleton_analysis.py evaluates the distribution of singleton variants in the gnomad dataset.
    The results are further analyzed and figures are generated using the gnomad_missense_singleton_analysis.Rmd markdown
	in the 'markdowns' directory.
